# Contributing Guidelines — Onsite .NET Workshop

Welcome to the FullScale × UP Cebu Web Dev .NET Workshop!  
This repository is the **single base repo** for all student teams. Please follow these rules carefully.

---

## 🚫 No GitHub Issues or Pull Requests

- GitHub Issues are **disabled** in this repository.
- Do **not** open PRs during the event.
- Judges will review your **team branch** directly.

---

## 🛠️ Self-Resolve Policy

Before asking a mentor for help, your team must:

1. **Write it down**
    - Error text
    - Hypothesis (what you think is wrong)
    - Attempted fix

2. **Check resources**
    - `/docs/BUGS_AND_FIXES.md`
    - `/docs/COMMON_PITFALLS.md`
    - Your AI assistant

3. **If still blocked**
    - Raise your hand
    - Present your **error → hypothesis → attempted fix** to a mentor

👉 Mentors will **coach your thinking**, not code for you.
